You are asked to prepare a memorandum to the small pizza company’s CEO 
describing how they could conduct such a study to support claims focusing on one or two of the company’s strengths (such as amount of toppings, speed of service, customer satisfaction, etc. ~ be creative). 
Be sure to include the research question(s) or claims you would propose to address and the different variables that should be recorded as part of the study (both what you would measure and how you would measure it). 
Additionally, describe how you would summarize the data (which graphical and numerical summaries you would report or possibly use in the ad) to help address the claim(s).

Claim: PDRHFP satisfies every taste, at the most locations near you!

Research questions:
    What Toppings from PDRHFP have you tasted?
        Variables measured:
        How they are measured:
    How would you rate the taste of each topping from 1 to 10?
        Variables measured:
        How they are measured:
    Minimum distance between college dorms and PDFHFP location?
        Variables measured:
        How they are measured:
